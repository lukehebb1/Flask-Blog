# Flask-Blog
A fitness focused Flask blog I made over the summer of 2019. Things you can do:

* Create a user with your email and password
* Set a profile picture
* Change your username or email address
* Reset your password via email
* Create a blog post with a title and content
* Go onto another users profile and see all of their posts
* Edit and delete posts

Feel free to alter this code and add to it.
